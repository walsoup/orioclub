## ðŸŽ¨ Using Alexia Bright Font

The site is configured to use **Alexia Bright** for the hero title. You need to add the font files:

1. Download Alexia Bright font files (.woff2, .woff, or .ttf)
2. Place them in `assets/fonts/` folder
3. Rename them to: `AlexiaBright.woff2`, `AlexiaBright.woff`, `AlexiaBright.ttf`
4. Refresh the page

See `assets/fonts/README.md` for detailed instructions.

**Don't have the font?** Change `title-font` in `content.txt` to any Google Font name instead.
